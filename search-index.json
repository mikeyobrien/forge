ci will update). deliverable: patch. prompt p-03 ‚Äî hello-world pwa shell context: infra is ready. **goal:** a vite react pwa served from `packages/web/` that shows \"hello notes\". **tasks** 1. run `pnpm create vite packages/web --template react-ts`. 2. move vite dep versions to root `package.json` resolutions. 3. add pwa plugin (`@vite-pwa/react`), configure manifest: name \"notes-on-issues\", short_name \"noi\". 4. modify `app.tsx` to render `<h1>hello notes</h1>`. 5. add vitest + react testing library setup inside `packages/web`. 6. provide one rtl test verifying header text. **tests** `pnpm --filter web test` passes. return patch. prompt p-04 ‚Äî authmanager skeleton (gh-notes-core) create new workspace package `packages/gh-notes-core`. **goal:** first slice of authmanager‚Äîno network calls yet. **tasks** 1. `mkdir packages/gh-notes-core && pnpm init`. 2. add peerdep `@octokit/oauth-app`. 3. declare public api: `src/auth/authmanager.ts` with: - interface `iauthmanager { login(): promise<void>;

separate branch?) no clipboard paste support for screenshots no drag-and-drop for images no media gallery or asset management impact : bloggers will need external tools for images, breaking the workflow 2. mobile experience ignored severity : high vim bindings are desktop-only no touch interface consideration no responsive editing experience no mobile-specific navigation patterns impact : completely unusable on mobile devices 3. multi-file operations absent severity : medium can‚Äôt rename/move posts no bulk operations no way to reorganize content structure no support for editing multiple files simultaneously impact : major limitation for content reorganization 4. branch/pr workflow missing severity : medium no draft branch support can‚Äôt create pull requests no preview deployments no staging environment integration impact : forces direct commits to main branch 5. collaboration features nonexistent severity : medium no awareness of other editors no locking mechanism no merge conflict ui beyond basic diff no comments or review process impact : single-user only, despite github being collaborative technical architecture flaws 1. performance bottlenecks large repository handling no pagination for file lists loading entire file tree into memory no lazy loading strategy fuzzy search will degrade with scale memory management indexeddb has browser-specific limits (firefox: 2gb, chrome: varies) no cleanup strategy for old drafts no memory pressure handling 2. security vulnerabilities auth proxy single point of failure if proxy is compromised, all tokens exposed no token rotation strategy session fixation vulnerabilities possible no 2fa support consideration content security markdown preview could execute scripts no csp for preview iframe user-generated content not sandboxed 3. state management issues sync conflicts optimistic updates without proper rollback no three-way merge for conflicts could lose data during concurrent edits no conflict queue or retry mechanism offline limitations service worker not handling all api calls no background sync api usage offline changes could be lost on clear storage 4. api design problems github api limitations not addressed 5000 requests/hour seems high but isn‚Äôt for active use no strategy for api limit approaching contents api has 1mb file size limit no pagination for large directories llm integration concerns api keys in browser localstorage (security risk) no fallback for llm failures no rate limiting for llm calls costs could spiral for active users user experience issues 1. onboarding complexity requiring oauth proxy setup is a barrier llm api key requirement adds friction no demo mode to try before setup setup wizard can‚Äôt handle edge cases 2. vim learning curve no progressive disclosure of features no non-vim fallback mode no interactive vim tutorial power users might expect more vim features than delivered 3. missing essential features no search and replace no find in files beyond fuzzy finder no templates beyond frontmatter no snippets or autocompletion no markdown shortcuts (bold, italic, link) 4. poor error communication generic error messages planned no error recovery suggestions no way to report issues from app no debug mode for power users implementation risks 1. scope creep inevitable vim mode will never be ‚Äúcomplete enough‚Äù users will expect full git features pressure to add frameworks/static site features mobile support will be demanded 2. technical debt accumulation vanilla js decision will limit hiring no framework means reinventing wheels testing complex interactions harder component reuse more difficult 3. deployment complexity auth proxy adds operational overhead two systems to monitor and scale cors issues likely during development secret management more complex 4. market positioning unclear competing with github.com‚Äôs editor vs code + github extension does more obsidian has bet"

      "content": "blog feature specification executive summary problem statement the current knowledge management system lacks a dedicated space for personal blog-style writing. while the para method (projects, areas, resources, archives) works well for organized knowledge, there‚Äôs no specific area designed for informal, chronological, personal content that would benefit from blog-like presentation and interaction features. proposed solution add a dedicated blog section to the static site generator that: creates a separate navigation path for blog posts stores blog posts in areas/blog/ with a flat structure integrates github issues as a commenting system maintains the existing document format while providing blog-specific navigation key benefits dedicated space for personal writing and thoughts reader engagement through github issues-based comments clean separation between knowledge management and blog content leverages existing infrastructure without major changes requirements functional requirements 1. blog storage structure location : areas/blog/ directory structure : flat (all posts directly in the blog directory) naming : standard markdown files (e.g., my-first-post.md ) format : reuse existing markdown + frontmatter format 2. navigation updates main navigation : add ‚Äúblog‚Äù as a fifth item after archives header : projects | areas | resources | archives | blog mobile : include blog in hamburger menu routing : /blog path shows blog listing page 3. blog listing page url : /blog display : minimal chronological list (newest first) content : show same information as current file cards: title date (publication/modified/created) tags summary (200 character excerpt) layout : reuse existing card layout for consistency 4. blog post pages url : /blog/[post-slug] template : reuse existing document template additions : comments section at bottom comment count in metadata ‚Äúdiscuss on github‚Äù link 5. comments system (github issues) backend : github issues api one issue per post : each blog post maps to one github issue issue title format : ‚Äúcomments: [blog post title]‚Äù issue labels : auto-add ‚Äúblog-comments‚Äù label display : show existing comments from the issue posting : ‚Äúadd comment‚Äù button links to github issue page authentication : users use their github accounts non-functional requirements 1. performance comments loaded asynchronously via javascript static site generation unaffected by comment count cache github api responses to respect rate limits 2. user experience seamless integration with existing site design clear indication that comments use github graceful fallback if github api unavailable 3. seo and accessibility blog posts fully indexable comments marked as user-generated content proper semantic html for blog structure acceptance criteria blog section creation /areas/blog/ directory exists and is recognized blog posts render with existing templates blog navigation item appears in header blog listing /blog route shows all blog posts posts sorted chronologically (newest first) file cards display correct metadata comments integration each blog post can map to a github

console.error('debug info'); // good - use a proper logger that writes to stderr only class logger { debug(msg) { if (process.env.mcp_enable_logging === 'true') { process.stderr.write(`[debug] ${msg}\\n`); } } } test server directly # test with direct json-rpc input echo '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"initialize\",\"params\":{\"protocolversion\":\"2024-11-05\",\"clientinfo\":{\"name\":\"test\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\"},\"capabilities\":{}},\"id\":1}' | node dist/index.js 2. configuration issues file locations claude cli looks for configuration in multiple places: .mcp.json in current directory .claude_project in project root local config via claude mcp add proper configuration format .mcp.json example { \"mcpservers\": { \"your-server-name\": { \"type\": \"stdio\", \"command\": \"node\", \"args\": [\"-r\", \"dotenv/config\", \"/absolute/path/to/dist/index.js\"], \"env\": { \"context_root\": \"/absolute/path/to/context\", \"log_level\": \"error\", \"mcp_enable_logging\": \"false\" } } } } important configuration tips always use absolute paths set mcp_enable_logging to ‚Äúfalse‚Äù for production use a wrapper script if needed for complex startup 3. permission issues symptoms ‚Äúi need permission to use this tool‚Äù tools appear but claude won‚Äôt execute them solutions bypass permissions (development only) claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p \"your prompt here\" grant permanent permissions click ‚Äúallow always‚Äù when prompted in claude desktop use /permissions command to add trusted domains 4. tool registration problems symptoms tools don‚Äôt appear in claude‚Äôs tool list tools appear with wrong names (e.g., mcp__servername__toolname ) debugging steps list available tools claude -p \"list all available tools including mcp tools\" check server registration claude mcp list verify tool schema ensure your tool returns proper json schema: { name: 'your_tool', description: 'what it does', inputschema: { type: 'object', properties: { // your parameters }, required: ['param1'] } } 5. debugging techniques enable debug logging (carefully) # only for debugging - disable for production export mcp_enable_logging=true export log_level=debug monitor server startup # create a debug wrapper #!/bin/bash echo \"starting mcp server...\" >&2 cd /path/to/server exec node -r dotenv/config dist/index.js test json-rpc communication // test-mcp.js const { spawn } = require('child_process');

// read response server.stdout.on('data', (data) => { console.log('response:', data.tostring()); }); 6. common mistakes to avoid don‚Äôt use console for debugging // wrong - breaks stdio console.log('debug:', data); // right - use stderr process.stderr.write(`debug: ${json.stringify(data)}\\n`); don‚Äôt forget error handling // always wrap tool execution async execute(params) { try { // your tool logic return { success: true, result: data }; } catch (error) { return { success: false, error: error.message }; } } don‚Äôt use relative paths // wrong const config = require('./config.json'); // right const config = require(path.resolve(__dirname, 'config.json')); 7. testing checklist before deploying your mcp server: remove all console.log/error/warn statements test with direct json-rpc input verify tool schemas are valid check all paths are absolute test with claude --dangerously-skip-permissions ensure error handling returns proper json verify server exits cleanly on errors 8. advanced debugging use mcp inspector for complex debugging, consider using the mcp inspector tool to monitor protocol messages. create test harness #!/bin/bash # test-harness.sh test_input='{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"tools/list\",\"params\":{},\"id\":1}' echo \"$test_input\" | node dist/index.js | jq . monitor file descriptors # check if server is reading from stdin lsof -p $(pgrep -f \"node.*index.js\") | grep -e \"0r|1w|2w\" quick fixes reference problem quick fix timeout remove all console output no tools check claude mcp list permission denied use --dangerously-skip-permissions tools not working verify json schema can‚Äôt debug write to stderr only example working setup server code (index.js) // no console output! const s"

// pattern to find replacement: string; // replacement text occurrence?: 'first' | 'last' | 'all'; // which occurrences to replace caseinsensitive?: boolean; } example usage: context_update({ path: 'projects/prompt-plan', update_mode: 'in_place', updates: [ { pattern: '**status**: ‚è≥ not started', replacement: '**status**: ‚úÖ complete', occurrence: 'first', }, ], }); 3. section-based updates add ability to update content within specific sections: interface sectionupdate { section: string; // section header to find level?: number; // header level (1-6) content?: string; // new content for the section subsection?: string; // optional subsection within the section operation?: 'replace' | 'append' | 'prepend'; } example usage: context_update({ path: 'projects/prompt-plan', update_mode: 'patch', sections: [ { section: 'prompt 4.3: integration testing & end-to-end validation', subsection: 'status', content: '‚úÖ complete', }, ], }); 4. structured field updates support for common document patterns: interface fieldupdate { field: string; // field name value: string | boolean | number; // new value format?: 'yaml' | 'markdown' | 'checkbox'; // field format } example usage: context_update({ path: 'projects/prompt-plan', update_mode: 'patch', fields: [ { field: 'status', value: 'completed', format: 'yaml' }, { field: 'modified', value: new date().toisostring(), format: 'yaml' }, { field: '- [ ] all tests pass', value: true, format: 'checkbox' }, ], }); 5. smart merge capabilities implement intelligent merging for common scenarios: interface mergeoptions { strategy: 'yaml' | 'sections' | 'lines'; conflict_resolution: 'ours' | 'theirs' | 'prompt'; preserve_formatting: boolean; } 6. update transactions support atomic updates with rollback: interface updatetransaction { operations: updateoperation[]; atomic: boolean; // all succeed or all fail validate?: (content: string) => boolean; // validation function } implementation plan phase 1: core pattern matching (week 1) implement pattern-based find/replace engine add regex support with proper escaping create unit tests for pattern matching handle edge cases (multiline patterns, special characters) phase 2: section awareness (week 2) implement markdown section parser add section-based content extraction create section update logic support nested sections and subsections phase 3: structured updates (week 3) implement yaml frontmatter field updates add checkbox state toggling support common markdown list patterns create field validation logic phase 4: smart merge engine (week 4) implement diff/merge algorithms add conflict detection and resolution create merge strategies for different content types build merge preview functionality phase 5: api integration (week 5) update mcp protocol definitions maintain backward compatibility create comprehensive api documentation build migration guide for existing users phase 6: testing & optimization (week 6) create comprehensive test suite performance optimization for large documents edge case handling and error recovery integration tests with real-world documents example use cases 1. updating prompt plan status // update a specific prompt's status context_update({ path: 'projects/static-website-generator-prompt-plan', update_mode: 'in_place', updates: [ { pattern: /#### prompt 4\\.3:.*?\\n\\*\\*status\\*\\*: ‚è≥ not started/s, replacement: (match) => match.replace('‚è≥ not started', '‚úÖ complete'), }, ], });

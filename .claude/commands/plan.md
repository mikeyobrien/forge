# /plan - Strategic Planning with Implementation Roadmap

I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan based on your specification, breaking down the work into manageable, testable chunks that build incrementally.

## Planning Approach

I'll analyze your specification and create multiple planning artifacts:

1. **Technical Architecture** - High-level design decisions
2. **Implementation Sequence** - Ordered steps building on each other
3. **Testing Strategy** - TDD approach with test categories
4. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes for each phase

## Process

1. **Load Project Context**

   - Read specification from `context/projects/`
   - Review any existing design documents
   - Check for related resources or constraints

2. **Analyze and Design**

   - Identify core components and their relationships
   - Determine technology stack and dependencies
   - Map data flow and state management
   - Consider performance and scalability

3. **Create Implementation Plan**

   - Break down into small, atomic steps
   - Prioritize based on dependencies
   - Define clear boundaries for each step
   - Include specific test requirements

4. **Generate Deliverables**
   - `spec.md` - Refined specification with technical details
   - `prompt_plan.md` - Step-by-step implementation prompts
   - `todo.md` - Actionable task list with checkboxes
   - Update project file with timeline and milestones

## Planning Principles

- **Incremental Value**: Each step delivers working functionality
- **Test-First**: Every feature starts with failing tests
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicit ordering based on requirements
- **Flexibility**: Plans can adapt as we learn more
- **Documentation**: Decisions and rationale are captured

## Execution Modes

Would you like me to optimize the plan for:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Emphasis on comprehensive testing, best for critical systems
2. **Rapid Prototyping** - Balance of testing and speed, good for MVPs
3. **Learning Project** - Extra documentation and exploration, ideal for new technologies

## Claude 4 Enhancements

The plan will leverage:

- Parallel tool usage for efficient execution
- Deep thinking steps for complex problems
- Explicit success criteria at each stage
- Built-in reflection points for course correction

Let me analyze your specification and create a comprehensive plan...

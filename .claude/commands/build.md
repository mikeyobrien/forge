# /build - Intelligent Implementation with TDD

I'll implement your project following the prompt plan, using test-driven development and Claude 4 best practices for optimal results.

## Implementation Process

1. **Context Loading**

   - Read current project state from PARA structure
   - Load prompt_plan.md and todo.md
   - Identify current implementation phase
   - Check for any blocking issues or dependencies

2. **Test-First Development**

   - Write comprehensive tests before implementation
   - Include unit, integration, and e2e tests as appropriate
   - Ensure tests fail initially (red phase)
   - Document test rationale and coverage

3. **Implementation**

   - Write minimal code to pass tests (green phase)
   - Follow existing code style and conventions
   - Use appropriate design patterns
   - Implement error handling and edge cases

4. **Refactoring**

   - Improve code clarity and maintainability
   - Eliminate duplication
   - Enhance performance where needed
   - Maintain test coverage

5. **Progress Tracking**
   - Update todo.md with completed tasks
   - Document decisions in project log
   - Note any deviations from original plan
   - Identify next steps

## Claude 4 Optimizations

I'll leverage advanced capabilities:

- **Parallel Tool Usage**: Execute multiple file operations simultaneously
- **Deep Analysis**: Use reflection steps for complex problem solving
- **Contextual Awareness**: Maintain understanding of entire codebase
- **Incremental Progress**: Small, verified steps with continuous testing

## Best Practices

- **Code Quality**: Follow clean code principles and SOLID design
- **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage with meaningful assertions
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic
- **Version Control**: Prepare clear, atomic commits
- **Performance**: Consider efficiency from the start

## Execution Modes

Based on your prompt plan, I can:

1. **Execute Next Step** - Continue from where we left off
2. **Focus on Specific Task** - Jump to a particular implementation item
3. **Review and Continue** - Assess progress before proceeding
4. **Debug and Fix** - Address any failing tests or issues

## Safety Checks

Before implementing, I'll verify:

- All prerequisites are met
- Tests are properly defined
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Dependencies are available

Let me load your project context and begin implementation...

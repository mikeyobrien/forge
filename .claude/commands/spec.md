# /spec - Interactive Specification Builder

I'll help you develop a thorough, step-by-step specification for your idea through an interactive conversation. This follows Harper Reed's approach to idea honing with enhancements for the PARA method and Claude 4 best practices.

## Process Overview

I'll ask you one question at a time to systematically explore and refine your idea. Each question builds on your previous answers, ensuring we capture all important details. My questions will cover:

- Core functionality and user needs
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Success criteria and measurable outcomes
- Potential challenges and edge cases
- Integration points and dependencies
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Security and error handling needs

## PARA Integration

Before we begin, I'll:

1. Check for existing context directory structure
2. Create a new project file in `context/projects/[project-name].md`
3. Document our entire conversation and decisions
4. Link to any relevant resources or existing areas

## Deliverables

At the end of our specification session, you'll have:

- A comprehensive, developer-ready specification document
- Clear problem statement and solution approach
- Detailed requirements with acceptance criteria
- Initial technical considerations
- Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- A project file tracking our progress

## Getting Started

Let's begin with understanding the core of your idea.

**What problem are you trying to solve, or what opportunity are you looking to capture?**

Please describe it in your own words - don't worry about being too technical or perfectly organized yet. I'll help structure and refine it through our conversation.

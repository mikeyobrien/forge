# /review - Code Review and Refactoring

I'll perform a thorough code review of your recent changes, identifying improvements and ensuring best practices are followed.

## Review Process

1. **Change Analysis**

   - Examine recent commits and modifications
   - Understand the intent and implementation
   - Check against original requirements
   - Verify test coverage

2. **Code Quality Assessment**

   - **Correctness**: Does it work as intended?
   - **Clarity**: Is the code readable and self-documenting?
   - **Consistency**: Does it follow project conventions?
   - **Completeness**: Are edge cases handled?
   - **Performance**: Are there optimization opportunities?

3. **Testing Review**

   - Verify test coverage is comprehensive
   - Check test quality and assertions
   - Identify missing test scenarios
   - Ensure tests are maintainable

4. **Documentation Check**
   - Update code comments where needed
   - Ensure README is current
   - Verify API documentation
   - Update PARA project files

# /plan - Strategic Planning with Implementation Roadmap (v2)

I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan based on your specification, following the enhanced document organization system for better structure and findability.

## Planning Approach

I'll analyze your specification and create multiple planning artifacts:

1. **Technical Architecture** - High-level design decisions
2. **Implementation Sequence** - Ordered steps building on each other
3. **Testing Strategy** - TDD approach with test categories
4. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes for each phase

## Process

1. **Load Project Context**

   - Read specification from `context/projects/`
   - Review any existing design documents
   - Check for related resources or constraints

2. **Analyze and Design**

   - Identify core components and their relationships
   - Determine technology stack and dependencies
   - Map data flow and state management
   - Consider performance and scalability

3. **Create Implementation Plan**

   - Break down into small, atomic steps
   - Prioritize based on dependencies
   - Define clear boundaries for each step
   - Include specific test requirements

4. **Generate Deliverables with Enhanced Organization**

   I'll create documents following these organization principles:

   ### Document Placement

   - All documents go in: `context/projects/[project-name]/`
   - Each document type has a specific prefix: `spec-`, `plan-`, `todo-`, `design-`, `report-`
   - No dates in filenames (dates are in frontmatter)

   ### Naming Pattern

   - `spec-[descriptive-name].md` - Technical specifications
   - `plan-[descriptive-name].md` - Implementation roadmaps
   - `todo-[descriptive-name].md` - Task tracking
   - `design-[descriptive-name].md` - Architecture designs
   - `report-[descriptive-name].md` - Progress reports

   ### Required Metadata

   Each document will include comprehensive frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: [Descriptive title]
   category: projects
   created: [ISO timestamp]
   modified: [ISO timestamp]
   tags: [relevant tags]
   # Enhanced metadata
   command_type: [spec/plan/todo/design/report]
   project: [project-name]
   status: [active/completed/superseded]
   generated_by: /plan
   implements: [path to source spec if applicable]
   related_docs:
     - [paths to related documents]
   context_source:
     - [source documents used]
   ---
   ```

   ### Conflict Resolution

   If a document with the same name exists, I'll make the name more specific by adding:

   - First: Key feature or component name
   - Second: Primary tag or category
   - Third: Document purpose modifier
   - Last resort: Timestamp suffix

## Deliverables

For project `[project-name]`, I'll create:

1. **Technical Specification**

   - Path: `context/projects/[project-name]/spec-[project-name].md`
   - Enhanced specification with implementation details
   - Links to requirements and constraints

2. **Implementation Roadmap**

   - Path: `context/projects/[project-name]/plan-implementation-roadmap.md`
   - Step-by-step prompts for implementation
   - Dependencies and success criteria

3. **Task List**

   - Path: `context/projects/[project-name]/todo-implementation.md`
   - Actionable tasks with priorities
   - Progress tracking checkboxes

4. **Project Index** (if new project)
   - Path: `context/projects/[project-name]/index.md`
   - Overview of all project documents
   - Maintained automatically

## Planning Principles

- **Incremental Value**: Each step delivers working functionality
- **Test-First**: Every feature starts with failing tests
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicit ordering based on requirements
- **Flexibility**: Plans can adapt as we learn more
- **Documentation**: Decisions and rationale are captured

## Execution Modes

Would you like me to optimize the plan for:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Emphasis on comprehensive testing, best for critical systems
2. **Rapid Prototyping** - Balance of testing and speed, good for MVPs
3. **Learning Project** - Extra documentation and exploration, ideal for new technologies

## Benefits of Enhanced Organization

- **Easy Navigation**: All project documents in one folder
- **Clear Relationships**: Metadata links related documents
- **No Duplicates**: Smart conflict resolution
- **Better Tracking**: Status and lifecycle management
- **Clean Names**: No dates cluttering filenames

Let me analyze your specification and create a comprehensive plan using this enhanced organization system...

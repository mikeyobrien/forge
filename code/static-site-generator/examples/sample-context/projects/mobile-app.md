# Mobile App Development

Building a cross-platform mobile application to extend our web presence to mobile devices.

## Overview

This project aims to create a native mobile experience that complements our [[Website Redesign Project]]. The app will provide core functionality optimized for mobile usage patterns.

## Technical Approach

### Framework Choice

We've selected React Native for its:

- Cross-platform development efficiency
- Shared codebase with web components
- Strong community and ecosystem
- Performance characteristics

### Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern:

```
components/
├── screens/
├── navigation/
├── services/
└── utils/
```

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication** - Secure login and registration
2. **Real-time Updates** - Push notifications and live data
3. **Offline Support** - Core functionality works without internet
4. **Responsive Design** - Adapts to different screen sizes

## Development Process

Our development follows agile methodologies documented in [[Agile Development Process]]. We're using the same [[Design System Guidelines]] as the web project.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API interactions
- End-to-end testing with Detox
- Manual testing on physical devices

## Deployment

The app will be distributed through:

- Apple App Store (iOS)
- Google Play Store (Android)
- Internal beta testing channels

## Resources

- [[React Native Documentation]]
- [[Mobile Design Patterns]]
- [[App Store Guidelines]]

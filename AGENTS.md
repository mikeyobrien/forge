# AGENTS Guidelines

This repository uses AGENTS.md to coordinate contributions from automated agents.

- **Review `CLAUDE.md` before starting work.** It contains additional rules and best practices that augment these instructions.
- **Document every change.** Pull requests will only be accepted if they include thorough documentation in the `context/` directory. Follow the PARA system (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) and place documents in the appropriate location.

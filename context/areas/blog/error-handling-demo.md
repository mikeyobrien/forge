# Demonstrating Error Handling in Comments

This blog post demonstrates how our commenting system handles errors gracefully. The `github_issue` field above is set to "999999", which likely doesn't exist in the repository. This will trigger our error handling code.

## What You Should See

Below this post, instead of comments, you should see an error message indicating that the issue was not found. This demonstrates our robust error handling:

1. **404 Errors**: When an issue doesn't exist, we show a clear message
2. **Rate Limiting**: If you refresh too many times, you'll see the rate limit message
3. **Network Failures**: If GitHub is down, you'll see a generic error message

## Error Handling Features

Our comment system includes:

- Specific error detection for different HTTP status codes
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging
- Visual styling that matches our site theme

## Try It Yourself

1. Check the browser console for error logs
2. Try changing the `github_issue` number in the markdown file
3. Test with no internet connection to see network error handling

This implementation ensures that even when things go wrong, users get helpful feedback rather than a broken experience.

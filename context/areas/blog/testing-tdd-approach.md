# Test-Driven Development with LLMs

Working with LLMs presents unique opportunities for test-driven development. Here's what we've learned.

## The TDD Cycle

1. **Write failing tests** - Define expected behavior
2. **Implement minimal code** - Just enough to pass
3. **Refactor** - Improve code quality
4. **Repeat** - Continue the cycle

## Benefits with LLMs

- Clear specifications help LLMs understand requirements
- Tests provide immediate feedback on implementation
- Refactoring ensures maintainable code

This approach has been invaluable in our framework development.

# GitHub Pages Deployment Implementation Summary

## Implementation Date: 2025-06-12

### Task Overview

Implemented GitHub Pages deployment with GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the static site after each commit to the main branch.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Explore (1 turn)

- Analyzed repository structure and build process
- Located build.sh and Makefile for build commands
- Identified build/ as the output directory
- Confirmed Rust-based static site generator in code/static-site-generator

### 2. Plan (1 turn)

- Created comprehensive todo list with 5 tasks
- Prioritized workflow creation and configuration
- Planned for both deployment approaches

### 3. Code (4 turns)

- Created .github/workflows directory
- Implemented two workflow files:
  - **deploy-gh-pages.yml**: Active workflow using gh-pages branch
  - **deploy.yml**: Alternative using GitHub Pages artifacts (disabled)
- Both workflows include:
  - Rust toolchain installation
  - Cargo dependency caching
  - Release build optimization
  - Automatic deployment on push to main

### 4. Verify (1 turn)

- Validated workflow syntax
- Checked file permissions and structure
- Ensured proper YAML formatting via prettier

### 5. Commit (1 turn)

- Staged all changes
- Created descriptive commit message
- Successfully committed with pre-commit hooks passing

### 6. Document (2 turns)

- Created comprehensive setup guide in resources/
- Documented both deployment approaches
- Included troubleshooting and optimization tips

## Key Decisions

1. **Dual Workflow Approach**: Created two workflows to give flexibility
2. **Default to gh-pages Branch**: More compatible and simpler setup
3. **Cargo Caching**: Implemented to speed up builds
4. **Force Orphan Commits**: Prevents gh-pages branch from growing too large

## Efficiency Insights

- **Parallel Operations**: Read multiple files simultaneously in exploration
- **Comprehensive Implementation**: Created both workflows upfront
- **Documentation First**: Wrote setup guide immediately after implementation
- **Total Turns**: 9 conversation turns from start to finish

## Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub:

1. Wait for first workflow run
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Select gh-pages branch as source
4. Site will be available at: https://[username].github.io/why/

## Process Improvements

- Could have checked for existing .github directory earlier
- Workflow validation tools weren't readily available but syntax was correct
- Pre-commit hooks automatically fixed formatting issues

## Outcome

Successfully implemented automatic GitHub Pages deployment that will trigger on every push to main branch, ensuring the static site stays up-to-date with the latest changes in the context directory.

# Merged Hero-Header Redesign Implementation

## Summary

Implemented the Option 1 redesign merging the PARA hero with the global header. A persistent logo, tagline and full navigation links are now visible on every page. The header collapses on scroll and includes a mobile drawer menu.

## Process Steps

1. Updated base and home page templates with new header markup.
2. Integrated the new navigation markup and active state handling.
3. Refactored CSS to style the new header and removed obsolete hero rules.
4. Added a small JavaScript file to handle scroll shrink and menu toggle.
5. Documented the change in the projects area.

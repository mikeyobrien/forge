Implemented Prompt P-01 to add basic tooling and quality gates:

- Added TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged configuration.
- Created `vitest.config.ts` and sample test `tools/health.spec.ts`.
- Updated `tools/self-check.sh` to run vitest.
- Modified Husky pre-commit hook to run lint and tests.

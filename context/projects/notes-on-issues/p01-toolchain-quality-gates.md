Implemented Prompt P-01 adding tooling and baseline quality gates:

- Installed TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, and Vitest.
- Added `tsconfig.base.json` with strict options.
- Placed all project tooling under `code/notes-on-issues`.
- Configured ESLint and Prettier via `eslint.config.mjs` and `.prettierrc.json`.
- Set up Husky pre-commit hook running lint, tests, and lint-staged formatting.
- Created `lint-staged.config.js` to format and lint staged files.
- Added minimal `code/notes-on-issues/vitest.config.ts` and health check test.
- Updated `tools/self-check.sh` to run the Vitest suite with this config.

Implemented Prompt P-00 to bootstrap the pnpm-based monorepo:

- Added `pnpm-workspace.yaml` listing `packages/*`.
- Created root `package.json` with minimal scripts and pnpm configuration.
- Initialized empty `packages/` directory with `.gitkeep`.
- Added placeholder `README.md`.
- Added `tools/self-check.sh` to verify pnpm is installed.

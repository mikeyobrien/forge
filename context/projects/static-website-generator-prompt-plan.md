# Prompt Plan: Static Website Generator

## Created: 2025-06-11 15:30:00

## Project Overview

### Objective

Build a static website generator in Rust (`para-ssg`) that converts PARA-organized markdown documents into a clean, browsable website with search functionality and Obsidian-compatible wiki links.

### Technical Context

- **Language**: Rust
- **Framework**: None (foundational packages only)
- **Testing**: Built-in Rust test framework with tempfile for integration tests
- **Integration**: Existing PARA context structure at `/Users/mobrienv/Code/why/context/`
- **Allowed Dependencies**: serde, pulldown-cmark, toml, serde_json, tempfile (dev)

### Success Definition

A working CLI tool that generates a complete static website from the PARA context directory, preserving structure, enabling wiki-style navigation, and providing client-side search functionality with a 70s earthy design theme.

## Overall Progress

## Execution Instructions

When using this plan with Claude Code, use this exact prompt for each session:

```
1. Open @projects/static-website-generator-prompt-plan.md and identify the next unfinished prompt (Status: ‚è≥ Not Started)
2. For the next incomplete prompt:
   - Verify if truly unfinished by checking the Success Criteria
   - Implement exactly as described in the prompt section
   - Ensure all deliverables are completed
   - Ensure all success criteria are met
   - Run tests and verify they pass: `cargo test`
   - Run linting: `cargo clippy`
   - Run formatting: `cargo fmt`
   - Commit changes to repository with descriptive commit message (no --no-verify)
   - Update the prompt plan to mark as completed (Status: ‚úÖ Complete) with timestamp and notes
3. Pause after completing the prompt for user review
4. Ask if ready to proceed with next unfinished prompt
```

## Quality Gates

Each prompt must pass these gates before marking complete:

- [ ] All deliverables achieved
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Tests written and passing: `cargo test`
- [ ] Code follows Rust conventions: `cargo clippy`
- [ ] Code properly formatted: `cargo fmt`
- [ ] Changes committed to git (no --no-verify)
- [ ] MCP validation passes: `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli ./code/mcp-server/start-mcp.sh --method tools/list`

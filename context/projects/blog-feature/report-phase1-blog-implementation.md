### File Changes
1. **New Files:**
   - `src/utils/blog.rs` - Blog utility functions
   - `context/areas/blog/first-blog-post.md` - Test blog post
   - `context/areas/blog/testing-tdd-approach.md` - Test blog post

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `src/utils/mod.rs` - Export blog module
   - `src/theme/templates.rs` - Add Blog navigation link
   - `src/generator/html.rs` - Add blog listing generator
   - `src/lib.rs` - Integrate blog generation

### Key Design Decisions
- Blog posts are identified by path pattern `areas/blog/`
- Reused existing category template for blog listing
- Maintained consistency with existing UI components
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Verification Results

### Build Output
```
ðŸ“Š Build Summary:
   - Documents parsed: 62
   - HTML pages generated: 67
   - Wiki links processed: 27
   - Build time: 0.21s
```

### Generated Files

- Date format in frontmatter must be ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2025-01-15T10:00:00Z`)
- Blog posts follow the same metadata structure as other documents
- The implementation is minimal and focused, following the specification exactly

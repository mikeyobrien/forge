# Project: Claude Commands Enhancement

## Overview

Recreating and enhancing Claude custom commands based on Harper's LLM workflow, PARA method, and Claude 4 best practices.

## Goals

- [x] Create comprehensive workflow from brainstorm to implementation
- [x] Integrate PARA method for context management
- [x] Follow Claude 4 prompt engineering best practices
- [x] Support both TDD and explore-plan-code-commit workflows
- [x] Provide multiple options for Sir Hugh to review

## Status

Current phase: Complete

## Implemented Commands

1. `/spec` - Interactive specification builder with Q&A approach
2. `/plan` - Strategic planning with spec.md, prompt_plan.md, and todo.md
3. `/build` - TDD implementation following prompt plans
4. `/review` - Comprehensive code review and refactoring
5. `/code` - All-in-one explore-plan-code-commit for well-defined tasks

## Next Steps

- Commands are ready for use in /Users/mobrienv/Code/why/.claude/commands/
- Can be copied to other projects as needed
- May be enhanced based on usage feedback

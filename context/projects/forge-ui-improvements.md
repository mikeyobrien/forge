# Forge UI Improvements - Navigation and Card Layout

## Overview

Implemented UI improvements to enhance the visual hierarchy and usability of the forge static site generator.

## Changes Made

### 1. Card Layout Width
- **Previous**: Cards had a max-width of 800px
- **Updated**: Increased max-width to 1200px
- **Rationale**: Better utilization of screen space on modern displays, allowing more content to be visible

### 2. Navigation Color States
Implemented distinct visual states for navigation items:

- **Default state**: `--text-secondary` (#b4b4b4) - Muted gray for unselected items
- **Hover state**: `--text-primary` (#f0f0f0) - Lighter gray providing subtle feedback
- **Active state**: `--accent-primary` (#0EA5E9) - Blue color clearly indicating current section

### 3. Navigation Hover Effect
- **Issue**: Double hover effect with both color change and underline
- **Solution**: Removed the color change on hover, keeping only the blue underline
- **Result**: Cleaner, more focused hover interaction

### 4. Header Height Optimization
- **Previous**: Header height of 140px (80px when scrolled)
- **Updated**: Reduced to 80px (60px when scrolled)
- **Benefit**: More vertical space for content visibility

## Implementation Details

All changes were made in `code/static-site-generator/src/theme/styles.rs`:

1. Modified `.file-cards` max-width property
2. Updated `.nav-item` hover states with explicit color values
3. Added transition effects for smooth color changes
4. Adjusted header heights in both default and scrolled states

## Visual Impact

- Improved content density without sacrificing readability
- Clearer navigation state indicators
- More professional hover interactions
- Better use of available screen real estate

## Testing

- Verified changes work correctly at different viewport sizes
- Confirmed navigation states are visually distinct
- Tested hover interactions for smooth transitions

# AGENTS Guidelines Update

This document summarizes the new contribution rules captured in `AGENTS.md`.

## Key Points

- **Check `CLAUDE.md`** for detailed instructions before starting any work.
- **Add documentation** for every pull request inside the `context/` directory.
- Organize documentation using the **PARA** method:
  - `projects/` for active deliverables
  - `areas/` for ongoing responsibilities
  - `resources/` for reference material
  - `archives/` for completed or inactive work

Following these guidelines keeps the repository knowledge base consistent and easy to navigate.

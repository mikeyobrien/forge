      "content": "ssg minimal theme improvements - 2025-06-11 overview successfully implemented major improvements to the static site generator’s minimal dark theme, addressing user feedback about empty columns, missing search functionality, and enhancing the para navigation experience. changes implemented 1. file modification time support problem : many files had empty date columns because they lacked frontmatter dates. solution : enhanced the parser to use file modification time as fallback. modified src/parser/mod.rs to read file metadata added fallback hierarchy: frontmatter date → modified → created → file mtime now shows actual dates (2025-06-11, 2025-06-12) instead of “—” // if no dates in frontmatter, use file modification time if metadata.date.is_none() && metadata.modified.is_none() && metadata.created.is_none() { if let ok(file_metadata) = fs::metadata(source_path) { if let ok(modified_time) = file_metadata.modified() { metadata.modified = some(datetime::from(modified_time)); } } } 2. search functionality restoration problem : search was completely hidden in the minimal theme. solution : restored full search with dark theme styling. re-enabled search script in templates updated search overlay to use dark theme colors (#2a2a2a background) keyboard shortcuts: ctrl+k , cmd+k , and / search results styled with proper dark theme contrast added footer hint: “press ctrl+k to search” 3. empty columns handling problem : tag columns were completely empty for many files. solution : added fallback content for empty states. empty tags now show “—” with muted styling added .no-tags css class for consistent visual treatment eliminated blank table cells let tags_str = if doc.tags.is_empty() { r#\"<span class=\"no-tags\">—</span>\"#.to_string() } else { doc.tags.iter() .map(|tag| format!(r#\"<span class=\"tag\">{}</span>\"#, html_escape(tag))) .collect::<vec<_>>() .join(\"\") }; 4. para hero section problem : user wanted more prominent para navigation. solution : added large, centered para letters as hero element. 4rem font size para letters with blue accent color each letter is clickable, linking to respective category hover effects with transform and color changes centered layout with proper spacing subtitle “recently modified files” below .para-letter { font-size: 4rem; font-weight: 700; color: var(--accent); text-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 122, 204, 0.3); transition: all 0.3s ease; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; } 5. enhanced dark theme consistency problem : search components didn’t match the dark theme. solution : unified color scheme across all components. search overlay: #2a2a2a background with #333 borders search results: dark styling with proper contrast highlight color: #007acc for search matches consistent color variables throughout technical details files modified src/parser/mod.rs - added file mtime support src/theme/styles.rs - para hero styles, improved empty states src/theme/templates.rs - home page template with hero section src/theme/search.rs - dark theme search styling src/generator/html.rs - updated home page generation css additions .para-hero - centered hero section .para-letters - flex layout for para letters .para-letter - large, interactive letters .para-subtitle - descriptive subtitle .no-tags - muted styling for empty tags configuration site title configurable via config.site_title (default: “forge”) search remains fully functional with keyboard shortcuts responsive design maintained results ✅ file dates : all files now show meaningful dates from either frontmatter or file modification time ✅ search functionality : full search capability restored with dark theme styling and ctrl+k shortcut ✅ no empty columns : tags column shows “—” for files without tags instead of blank space ✅ enhanced navigation : large, clickable para letters provide prominent category navigation ✅ visual consistency : complete dark theme with proper contrast and modern aesthetics user experience improvements better information density : no more empty cells or missing data improved navigation : para hero makes category access more prominent maintained functionality : search didn’t sacrifice minimalism enhanced accessibility : proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation responsive design : works well on mobile and desktop build performance build time: ~0.09s for 21 documents no performance impact from new features file modification time reading is efficient search index generation unchanged the improvements successfully balance minimalism with functionality, providing a clean, dark interface that doesn’t sacrifice important features like search while making navigation more intuitive through the prominent para letters."

      "content": "context update tool enhancement plan problem statement the current context_update tool has significant limitations: replace_content=false blindly appends, causing duplicates replace_content=true replaces everything, losing granular control no ability to update specific sections or fields in-place cannot intelligently merge changes with existing content this is particularly problematic for structured documents like prompt plans where we need to update specific fields (status, completion time) without affecting the rest of the document. design goals intelligent updates : update specific parts of documents without affecting others pattern matching : find and replace based on patterns/regex section awareness : update content within specific sections/headers structured updates : support common document patterns (status fields, checkboxes, etc.) backward compatibility : maintain existing api for simple use cases proposed implementation 1. enhanced update modes add an update_mode parameter with the following options: enum updatemode { replace = 'replace', // current behavior with replace_content=true append = 'append', // current behavior with replace_content=false patch = 'patch', // new: apply specific changes merge = 'merge', // new: intelligently merge content inplace = 'in_place', // new: update specific patterns } 2. pattern-based updates add support for finding and updating specific patterns: interface patternupdate { pattern: string | regexp; // pattern to find replacement: string; // replacement text occurrence?: 'first' | 'last' | 'all'; // which occurrences to replace caseinsensitive?: boolean; } example usage: context_update({ path: 'projects/prompt-plan', update_mode: 'in_place', updates: [ { pattern: '**status**: ⏳ not started', replacement: '**status**: ✅ complete', occurrence: 'first', }, ], }); 3. section-based updates add ability to update content within specific sections: interface sectionupdate { section: string; // section header to find level?: number; // header level (1-6) content?: string; // new content for the section subsection?: string; // optional subsection within the section operation?: 'replace' | 'append' | 'prepend'; } example usage: context_update({ path: 'projects/prompt-plan', update_mode: 'patch', sections: [ { section: 'prompt 4.3: integration testing & end-to-end validation', subsection: 'status', content: '✅ complete', }, ], }); 4. structured field updates support for common document patterns: interface fieldupdate { field: string; // field name value: string | boolean | number; // new value format?: 'yaml' | 'markdown' | 'checkbox'; // field format } example usage: context_update({ path: 'projects/prompt-plan', update_mode: 'patch', fields: [ { field: 'status', value: 'completed', format: 'yaml' }, { field: 'modified', value: new date().toisostring(), format: 'yaml' }, { field: '- [ ] all tests pass', value: true, format: 'checkbox' }, ], }); 5. smart merge capabilities implement intelligent merging for common scenarios: interface mergeoptions { strategy: 'yaml' | 'sections' | 'lines'; conflict_resolution: 'ours' | 'theirs' | 'prompt'; preserve_formatting: boolean; } 6. update transactions support atomic updates with rollback: interface updatetransaction { operations: updateoperation[]; atomic: boolean; // all succeed or all fail validate?: (content: string) => boolean; // validation function } implementation plan phase 1: core pattern matching (week 1) implement pattern-based find/replace engine add regex support with proper escaping create unit tests for pattern matching handle edge cases (multiline patterns, special characters) phase 2: section awareness (week 2) implement markdown section parser add section-based content extraction create section update logic support nested sections and subsections phase 3: structured updates (week 3) implement yaml frontmatter field updates add checkbox state toggling support common markdown list patterns create field validation logic phase 4: smart merge engine (week 4) implement diff/merge algorithms add conflict detection and resolution create merge strategies for different content types build merge preview functionality phase 5: api integration (week 5) update mcp protocol definitions maintain backward compatibility create comprehensive api documentation build migration guide for existing users phase 6: testing & optimization (week 6) create comprehensive test suite performance optimization for large documents edge case handling and error recovery integration tests with real-world documents example use cases 1. updating prompt plan status // update a specific prompt's status context_update({ path: 'projects/static-website-generator-prompt-plan', update_mode: 'in_place', updates: [ { pattern: /#### prompt 4\\.3:.*?\\n\\*\\*status\\*\\*: ⏳ not started/s, replacement: (match) => match.replace('⏳ not started', '✅ complete'), }, ], });

} } } test server directly # test with direct json-rpc input echo '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"initialize\",\"params\":{\"protocolversion\":\"2024-11-05\",\"clientinfo\":{\"name\":\"test\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\"},\"capabilities\":{}},\"id\":1}' | node dist/index.js 2. configuration issues file locations claude cli looks for configuration in multiple places: .mcp.json in current directory .claude_project in project root local config via claude mcp add proper configuration format .mcp.json example { \"mcpservers\": { \"your-server-name\": { \"type\": \"stdio\", \"command\": \"node\", \"args\": [\"-r\", \"dotenv/config\", \"/absolute/path/to/dist/index.js\"], \"env\": { \"context_root\": \"/absolute/path/to/context\", \"log_level\": \"error\", \"mcp_enable_logging\": \"false\" } } } } important configuration tips always use absolute paths set mcp_enable_logging to “false” for production use a wrapper script if needed for complex startup 3. permission issues symptoms “i need permission to use this tool” tools appear but claude won’t execute them solutions bypass permissions (development only) claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p \"your prompt here\" grant permanent permissions click “allow always” when prompted in claude desktop use /permissions command to add trusted domains 4. tool registration problems symptoms tools don’t appear in claude’s tool list tools appear with wrong names (e.g., mcp__servername__toolname ) debugging steps list available tools claude -p \"list all available tools including mcp tools\" check server registration claude mcp list verify tool schema ensure your tool returns proper json schema: { name: 'your_tool', description: 'what it does', inputschema: { type: 'object', properties: { // your parameters }, required: ['param1'] } } 5. debugging techniques enable debug logging (carefully) # only for debugging - disable for production export mcp_enable_logging=true export log_level=debug monitor server startup # create a debug wrapper #!/bin/bash echo \"starting mcp server...\" >&2 cd /path/to/server exec node -r dotenv/config dist/index.js test json-rpc communication // test-mcp.js const { spawn } = require('child_process'); const server = spawn('node', ['dist/index.js'], { stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe'], }); // send initialize request server.stdin.write( json.stringify({ jsonrpc: '2.0', method: 'initialize', params: { protocolversion: '2024-11-05', clientinfo: { name: 'test', version: '1.0' }, capabilities: {}, }, id: 1, }) + '\\n', ); // read response server.stdout.on('data', (data) => { console.log('response:', data.tostring()); }); 6. common mistakes to avoid don’t use console for debugging // wrong - breaks stdio console.log('debug:', data); // right - use stderr process.stderr.write(`debug: ${json.stringify(data)}\\n`); don’t forget error handling // always wrap tool execution async execute(params) { try { // your tool logic return { success: true, result: data }; } catch (error) { return { success: false, error: error.message }; } } don’t use relative paths // wrong const config = require('./config.json'); // right const config = require(path.resolve(__dirname, 'config.json')); 7. testing checklist before deploying your mcp server: remove all console.log/error/warn statements test with direct json-rpc input verify tool schemas are valid check all paths are absolute test with claude --dangerously-skip-permissions ensure error handling returns proper json verify server exits cleanly on errors 8. advanced debugging use mcp inspector for complex debugging, consider using the mcp inspector tool to monitor protocol messages. create test harness #!/bin/bash # test-harness.sh test_input='{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"tools/list\",\"params\":{},\"id\":1}' echo \"$test_input\" | node dist/index.js | jq . monitor file descriptors # check if server is reading from stdin lsof -p $(pgrep -f \"node.*index.js\") | grep -e \"0r|1w|2w\" quick fixes reference problem quick fix timeout remove all console output no tools check claude mcp list permission denied use --dangerously-skip-permissions tools not working verify json schema can’t debug write to stderr only example working setup server code (index.js) // no console output! const s"

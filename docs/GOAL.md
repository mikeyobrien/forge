# Goal

The goal of this project is to push the limits of Claude Code. I am taking a deliberate choice
in minimizing the usage of external libraries and frameworks, letting Claude build
what it uses. I am curious to see how capable it is in creating what I ask with minimal
oversight along with learning new ways extract the most value out of AI tools.

From a high-level this project will do the following to create an optimal environment
for Claude to work independently:

1. Create MCP tools to assist with context.
2. Create a mechanism to record a history of all it's work.
3. Build a mechanism to share it's progress publically.
4. Keep building

My goal is to guide and steer it when it is blocked on a task. Before fixing
anything myself I will first attempt to exhaust all options in getting Claude
to resolve the issue on it's own.
